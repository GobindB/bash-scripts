# bash-scripts
Some scripts that make life with my oh-my-ZSH shell easier. (Periodically updated) 

!! Disclaimer: Probably not a great idea to copy paste any of these into your shell blindly for a number of reasons; different shell config, maybe I snuck in a ```sudo rm -rf /``` etc. Read through the scripts first and use at your own risk. Enjoy :)
